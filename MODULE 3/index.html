          <h2>Chicken</h2>
        A CENTURY AGO you’d eat steak and lobster when you couldn’t afford chicken.
Today it can cost less than the potatoes you serve with. What happened in the years
between was an extraordinary marriage of technology and the market.
John Steele Gordon, American Heritage, September 1996 | Volume 47, Issue 5
King Henri IV of France was a great king. He was also, perhaps, the world’s first real
politician—for in the course of his ten-year battle to secure the French throne for the
Bourbon dynasty he began deliberately enlisting public opinion and even invented the
political slogan to help him do so. Instinctively knowing the shortest route to his
people’s hearts, he told them, “I want there to be no peasant in my kingdom so poor
that he is unable to have a chicken in his pot every Sunday.”
Henri IV’s choice of chicken to symbolize prosperity was no accident, for it had
always been a dish reserved, because of its cost, for special occasions like Sunday
dinner, holidays, and celebrations. And for fully three hundred years after Henri’s
time, nothing happened to change that. Indeed, as late as 1928 the Republican party,
cribbing shamelessly, promised the American people continued prosperity and “a
chicken in every pot.” The Republicans, of course, did not deliver on their promises,
and the Great Depression ended seventy years of Republican political dominance in
this country.
IT IS IRONIC, THEN, NOT to mention instructive, that in the six-plus decades since,
the free market has delivered what the politicians could not: cheap chicken. So cheap,
in fact, that today the chicken you buy at the supermarket for dinner can cost less than
the potatoes you intend to serve with it. How it evolved so quickly from a luxury that
only the rich could regularly afford into the cheapest form of quality animal protein
available makes a very American—and very capitalist—story.
But there is one major difference between the history of the modern American poultry
industry and that of most other segments of the American economy. The oil industry
rose under the dominance of John D. Rockefeller. The mass-market automobile was
the brainchild of one genius, Henry Ford. The computer revolution of the present day
has been ever increasingly influenced by William Gates and Microsoft.
The poultry industry, however, has no single, outstanding figure. Instead, hundreds if
not thousands of individuals, each with, at best, only local fame and no intention
aforethought, created the modern industry. Many failed and fell by the wayside;
others succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. But as these individuals pursued their
self-interests with hard work, insight, and the assumption of risk, they greatly
benefited the economy as a whole. Collectively, they constitute a nearly perfect
example of Adam Smith’s invisible hand at work.
Chickens were among the last of the major domestic animals to come under the sway
of man and the only one, aside from the water buffalo, to come from eastern Asia and
Africa. But the chicken’s impact —gastronomic, agricultural, religious, literary,
economic, and even psychological—has been immense.
Gallus gallus , the red jungle fowl, is still common in the wooded areas of India and
Southeast Asia, from the foothills of the Himalayas to Sumatra. It is the ancestor of all
domestic chickens; indeed it remains conspecific with them, although a few other
chickenlike birds, such as pheasants and other species of jungle fowl, probably
contributed genes.
Jungle fowl live in small groups consisting of one cock and several hens. The cock is
a gorgeous bird, with a fiery red head and saddle feathers. The hackles (the neck
feathers) shade downward from red to yellow while the feathers of the breast and tail
are an iridescent green-black. The hen is much plainer, a rusty brown, which helps
conceal her during the period of incubation, for these are ground-nesting birds.
The lean, tightly muscled, and undoubtedly tough-as-rubber-bands red jungle fowl
weighs only about two pounds when fully mature and was not originally domesticated
for purposes of eating. Instead, two peculiar characteristics of the cock probably led to
the bird’s coming to live with humankind. One is his habit of crowing very loudly at
the first hint of daylight, thus serving as a natural alarm clock in an agricultural
community. The crowing bird is still a potent symbol of the dawn generations after
most Americans last heard it.
The second habit that led to domestication is the cock’s extreme and unrelenting, even
unto death, aggressiveness toward other, unfamiliar males of his species. It is this
characteristic that makes the sport of cockfighting so exciting, so bloody, and so
freighted with masculine symbolism that it persists, indeed flourishes, in this country
today despite decades of attempted legal repression.
It soon became obvious that cocks had other habits that caused human males to
identify strongly with them. One, certainly, is an apparently insatiable sexual appetite
that makes them paragons of virility and sexual ardor. It is no coincidence whatever
that the word that denotes the male of the species Gallus gallus is also, in language
after language, a slang expression for the male sex organ. (As you might expect, the
word rooster was used as an early-nineteenth-century euphemism, to spare the ears of
the suddenly genteel.)
Hens, for their part, quickly came to symbolize much that is maternal and feminine.
People saw in the tightly structured society of chickens, among the most social of all
birds, a mirror of their own species, among the most social of all mammals.
Consequently, no domestic animal other than the dog has so many symbolic
connotations as the chicken does. The mammoth newRandom House Historical
Dictionary of American Slang devotes no fewer than six pages to the
word chicken and its compounds.Hens, cocks, biddies, chicks , and others take up yet
more pages.
The chicken spread from India toward the West and reached Greece at the time of the
Persian Wars (Greeks still call chickens “Persian birds"). By the Roman era it was
common throughout Western Europe. The Romans and Greeks thought that chickens
were useful as diviners of the future, and Roman military leaders would offer a flock
grain before a battle. If the birds devoured it, the auguries were good. If they did not,
the general often would avoid battle. During the Punic Wars, one Roman admiral was
so annoyed when the chickens, perhaps seasick, refused to eat that he threw them
overboard, saying, “If they will not eat, let them drink!” and attacked anyway. He lost
badly.
Chickens were often carried on shipboard for reasons other than forecasting the
outcome of battles, for by Roman times chickens and their eggs had come to be used
for food. They made excellent shipboard livestock. They took up little space, would
eat nearly anything, and provided both fresh meat and eggs to people who otherwise
had to subsist on ship’s biscuits and salted meat.
It is no wonder, then, that chickens arrived in the New World at very nearly the same
time as Europeans. By 1609, only two years after its founding, Jamestown, Virginia,
had as many as five hundred. The terrible famine in the winter of 1609-10 reduced
that population to zero, or very nearly so. But once the colony was restocked from the
West Indies the following spring, the chicken’s place in North America was secure.
For a very long time, the Americans’ husbandry of chickens was a casual affair at best,
for chickens, unlike most barnyard animals, are quite self-sufficient. Often they
weren’t even fed or housed but made their own way by snapping up grain spilled by
the other animals, along with bugs, worms, and table scraps. At night they roosted in
trees, which is why in those days white-feathered chickens were unpopular, being too
easily spotted by foxes, hawks, and other predators.
Traditionally it was the job of the youngest child to hunt for the eggs every day, and
surplus eggs sold locally were regarded as a small source of independent income for
the farm wife, her so-called egg money.
But the average hen before the twentieth century laid only about thirty eggs a year,
mostly in the spring. As a result, eggs varied greatly in price depending on the season,
being cheapest in the spring and quite expensive in the late fall and early winter.
Chickens for eating were most abundant in the early summer when the hatch of that
year (called the spring chickens, a term that, decades after it disappeared from
commerce, still connotes extreme youth) was ready for slaughter. As the year
progressed, the chickens available in the marketplace became older and tougher but
more flavorful.
Because of this seasonality, the price of chickens in the market also varied
considerably over the course of the year. But there was another reason chicken was,
even in summer, a luxury dish: The production of chickens was strictly an amateur
affair with little if any structure to the commercial channels that led from millions of
small farm flocks to urban markets.
As a result, ladies’ magazines of the turn of the century frequently contained advice
on how to substitute veal for chicken. Veal was then a drug in the market, a byproduct
of an already professionalized and flourishing dairy industry that was at the time
popular only with Italians and other immigrants from the Mediterranean.
The first change from the age-old way Americans husbanded chickens came in the
1830s when birds from China were imported as exotics into Britain. These so-called
Cochins, which have fluffy plumage and feathered legs, caused a sensation in both the
British Empire and the United States and set off a craze for breeding show chickens
with extravagant features such as yards-long tail feathers and crests of feathers around
the head.
Farmers began selectively breeding chickens as well, and breeds with wonderful
names, like Plymouth Rock, Wyandotte, and Orpington (along with the Australian 
version, the Australorp). But because there were no fixed standards, the genetic chaos
ruled. Each farmer had, in effect, his own breed of chicken. So in 1873 the American
Poultry Association was formed to set standards and help develop chickens that could
be relied upon to breed true. The purpose of this at the time was no more than to bring
order and predictability to a popular hobby, but the result was the development of
genetically reliable stock that would be used in the next century to utterly transform
the chicken.
By the last third of the nineteenth century, interest in poultry raising as something
more than a hobby was growing quickly. The years between 1870 and 1926 saw the
advent of no fewer than 350 magazines devoted to poultry. In 1880 the census
counted the nation’s chicken population for the first time, finding 102 million of them.
By 1890 the national flock had soared to 258 million. In 1891 Cornell University
became the first agricultural college to offer a formal course in poultry husbandry, and
the raising of chickens began its century-long shift from a sideline of the family farm
to a form of agribusiness.
There are numerous stages between the apparently permanent gleam in a rooster’s eye
and dinner. These are breeding, incubating, hatching, raising, slaughtering, dressing,
transporting, selling, cooking, and eating. Of these ten steps, only the last is still
handled the way it was at the turn of the century, and even that, at least in terms of
where Americans eat chicken, has changed significantly.
The first change in traditional poultry husbandry was the introduction of commercial
chicks. Before, people wanting to start a flock would either buy fertilized eggs from a
local farmer and incubate them themselves (often in a warm spot on or near the
kitchen stove) or buy a “trio,” two hens and a cock. After the first chicks hatched,
nature was allowed to take its course.
In 1873 a man named Jacob Graves patented an incubator and offered chicks two to
four weeks old for sale. But it was Joseph P. Wilson of Stockton, New Jersey, who
turned the raising of baby chicks into a business. In 1887, using hot water as a heat
source, he built his own incubator, which could handle up to four hundred eggs at a
time. By 1892 he had begun taking advantage of the fact that newborn chicks, because
they absorb the remnants of the yolk just before hatching, can go without food or
water for up to thirty-six hours. Wilson started shipping day-old chicks as far as
Chicago by railway express.
The advantages of using artificial hatcheries were soon apparent. For one thing, this
new technique allowed the supply of chickens to be smoothed out over the year to
more nearly match demand. This, of course, dampened price swings. By 1918 there
were two hundred fifty hatcheries in operation in this country. Only nine years later
there were more than ten thousand, and more than half the baby chicks produced in
the country were artificially incubated. As their numbers grew (there would be a great
shakeout in the early 1930s, however), these new hatcheries competed fiercely by
offering not only lower prices but also superior chickens bred to reach selling weight
sooner in life, thus requiring less feed and yielding a greater profit.
This drive for the ever-quicker-growing chicken has been instrumental in turning
chicken from a luxury food into an everyday affair. In 1900 a newly hatched chick
required sixteen weeks to reach two pounds, large enough for frying. Southern 
farmers prided themselves on having frying chickens ready for the Fourth of July.
Today, chicks reach four pounds, big enough for roasting, in just seven weeks.
But until the mid-1920s the raising of chickens remained a sideline operation, run by
farmers’ wives. Agricultural experts in the early years of the century thought the
situation would never change, because it would not be possible to compete with a
system that, in effect, utilized both free labor and free food and provided millions of
farmwomen with a source of independent income they would be loath to part with.
The experts, however, were looking mostly at the Midwest, the leading area of the
country for egg production at that time, where the farms were large and prosperous,
thanks to the area’s incomparably good soil and usually benevolent weather. These
farms tended to specialize in basic foodstuffs like wheat, corn, cattle, and hogs. The
raising of chickens as a major crop would have been a misallocation of resources.
Other areas of the country, however, had very different economic needs. The
Delmarva Peninsula, east of Chesapeake Bay, for instance, had rich, sandy,
well-drained soil and a flat landscape. But its proximity to Baltimore, Philadelphia,
and New York had made it a natural area for truck farming. And truck farming is a
feast-or-famine business, peculiarly sensitive not only to the vagaries of the
marketplace but to the weather as well. A steadier source of income was most
welcome on the Delmarva, and it was there that the chicken business really became a
business.
The first person on the peninsula to raise chickens expressly for the market rather than
simply sell what exceeded domestic needs was Mrs. Wilmer Steele. She ordered 500
chicks in 1923 and sold the 387 that survived to two pounds for sixty-two cents a
pound, live weight.
This produced a very handsome profit indeed. In today’s money (that is, after
allowing for inflation), Mrs. Steele received about five dollars a pound, wholesale, for
her chickens. Not surprisingly, word of these profits spread fast. In 1925 the state of
Delaware produced fifty thousand chickens for market and just the next year topped
one million. By 1934 the peninsula was putting out seven million broilers a year, and
production continued to soar as costs per bird declined steadily and demand rose
accordingly.
Chickens in such numbers could neither be fed in the traditional way, with table
scraps and leftovers from other livestock, nor hunt and peck on their own. So
hundreds of companies began to produce special feeds for broilers. And the science of
chicken nutrition began its explosive elaboration as they competed for customers by
offering a superior product. Because chickens mature quickly and few ethical
constraints have been applied to experimentation, our understanding of chicken
nutrition now exceeds our grasp of that for any other domestic animal and even for
humans.
In this new field, one of the first developments to have a major impact on the market
price of the finished product was the introduction of vitamin D, without which
calcium cannot be metabolized and rickets develops. But like all other animals,
including humans, chickens need sunlight in order to synthesize vitamin D on their
own.
Raising broiler chickens outdoors exposed them to the uncertainties of the weather,
predators, and disease. But the adding of cod-liver oil (and later the purified vitamin
itself) to chicken feed allowed chickens to be raised in large, roofed sheds where
temperature, diet, and lighting could be controlled for maximum weight gain.
The results of this ever-deepening knowledge of chicken nutrition were quick in
coming. The great food writer Clementine Paddleford marveled as early as 1943 that
“ten years ago it took 6 ½ pounds of feed to produce one pound of broiler meat.
Today four pounds of feed will do the same job.” Fifty years later it requires only
about one and three-quarter pounds of feed to produce a pound of meat, a conversion
ratio that would have seemed, at the turn of the century, close to that seen in the
biblical miracle of the loaves and the fishes.
With the feed companies having more and more direct interest in the farmers’ success,
the feed salesmen began to provide advice, not only on what and how to feed chickens
but how to care for them as well. It was not a long step from feed mills providing
credit and advice to feed mills contracting with farmers to raise birds that belonged to
the feed mills, in exchange for a guaranteed price per pound. The separate links in the
chain were beginning to join together in what economists call vertical integration.
One fundamental split, however, occurred at this time: the separation of egg farming
from chicken farming. The first commercial broilers were mostly surplus Leghorns,
actually bred for their egg production. Leghorns lay white eggs in great quantity but,
precisely because of that fact, do not put on weight well. The Boston market, unlike
the rest of the country, preferred brown eggs, and these came from heavier breeds,
many with such New England-inspired names such as Rhode Island Red, New
Hampshire, and Plymouth Rock.
New England hatcheries began shipping crosses of the heavy breeds, which gain
weight much more rapidly than do Leghorns, to the burgeoning broiler farms on the
Delmarva Peninsula and soon to other areas of the country as well. And hatcheries
began breeding new crosses from heavy stock specially for rapid weight gain.
They also continued to breed champion egg layers from Leghorns and other so-called
Mediterranean breeds. Again, the increase in production has been staggering. At the
turn of the century, thirty eggs a year was the norm. A champion might produce fifty.
By the 1930s a hen laying a hundred eggs a year was a candidate for a ribbon at the
county fair. Today a hen that doesn’t lay two hundred and fifty is a candidate for the
cat-food factory.
Other developments began in the 1930s that transformed not the egg—an evolutionary
creation of such awesome perfection that it could hardly be improved upon—but the
way eggs were farmed. Eggs, like chickens, had long been simply a byproduct of
other kinds of farming, produced a few at a time by millions of flocks that seldom
numbered more than fifty birds each. And because the chickens largely fended for
themselves, there were few out-of-pocket expenses and so no one cared about costs.
As a result, between 1910, when the federal government began keeping track of egg
production and prices, and 1943 the price of a dozen eggs remained remarkably
constant in real terms.
But the great depression forced millions of small farms out of existence, reducing the
number of flocks, and some of the remaining farmers, seeing opportunity, began to
specialize in egg production. Suddenly there were people who, in their own interest, 
began to care about the cost of producing eggs and thus about the way of producing
eggs: professional egg farmers. Betty Macdonald’s classic memoir The Egg and I (as
well as the equally classic movie based on it, starring Claudette Colbert, Fred Acura,
and Marjorie Main) had its origins in this subtle economic shift—proof that art can
arise from anything.
The first change these new egg farmers made from traditional poultry husbandry, as
the broiler raisers before them had done, was to begin confining their chickens. When
the birds ran free, their eggs had to be hunted for, and every day was
Easter—although, to be sure, chickens tend to lay their eggs in the same places over
and over again. This was labor intensive, and many eggs were overlooked, fell victim
to such predators as rats and snakes, or were broken. Confinement increased egg
production per bird immediately and thus ensured higher profits for farmers and lower
prices for consumers.
But confinement brought its own problems. At first the birds were usually kept in
houses that had dirt floors covered with wood shavings. As the manure built up, so
did the incidence of disease as the chickens scratched, which chickens will do even
when they are not hungry. To solve this problem, farmers began putting their chickens
in houses with wire floors so that the droppings could fall through and be removed.
The health of the chickens, and thus their egg production, greatly improved.
The keeping of birds in tiers of wire cages, where they could be fed, watered, and
cared for more easily, soon followed. The price of a dozen eggs began a fifty-year
decline. Much of that continuing decline has come from ever- increasing economies
of scale as the number of egg farms has steadily dropped and the number of chickens
at each farm has increased. In the 1940s an egg farm with a hundred thousand birds
was considered very large. Today a farm needs ten million birds to have that status.
As a result of these enormous numbers—an egg farm with ten million birds produces
well over half a million dozen eggs per day —even the most minor savings per egg
makes major improvements to the bottom line. Just a tenth-of-a-cent drop per egg in
production costs increases the daily gross profit by more than six thousand dollars, or
over two million dollars per year.
Although the number of independent egg farms has drastically declined since the days
Betty MacDonald wrote about, there are nonetheless still about 350 companies in the
United States, and competition among them remains fierce. Much of the decreased
cost that ensues from innovation, then, is necessarily passed along to the consumer as
lower prices. This, in turn, requires an unceasing search for new ways to drive down
costs if profits are to be maintained, just as Adam Smith predicted.
Technology, genetics and decreases in the use of manpower—the last almost always
representing the most expensive economic input nowadays—have made profits
possible. A state-of-the-art hen house today holds around a hundred thousand birds in
tier after tier of cages stretching the length of two football fields. Water is piped in
while robots dispense food every hour in carefully controlled amounts. The cages are
slightly inclined so that the eggs produced roll down onto a conveyor belt and are
whisked away for cleaning, grading, and packing.
Some houses are built underground to save heating and air-conditioning costs, while
light, which stimulates egg production, is provided at the optimal level. About the
only thing that is not automated today is the removal of dead chickens. Only about 
three in ten thousand die per day in a well-regulated hen house (just about half again
the human mortality rate in this country). But out of two hundred fifty thousand, that
is still seventy-five dead birds a day that must be removed immediately to prevent
disease.
In this wholly artificial—some would say cruel—environment, even the genes that the
birds inherit have been determined by the process of artificial evolution called
selective breeding. This process has been the biggest single factor in increasing egg
production per bird and per pound of feed so dramatically. But the genes themselves
remain unaltered for now (the new technology of genetic engineering will, without
doubt, soon change that). And, unfortunately for the farmer, high egg laying and
aggression are genetically linked. If you want the one, you have to take the other as
well.
Aggression among the closely confined birds on a modern egg farm has been a major
problem, as the birds sort out their social standings with their beaks. Other
technologies have come to the rescue, however. Hatcheries now routinely remove a
portion of the upper bill; this decreases the mayhem the birds can cause without
reducing efficiency in feeding. In the 1950s it was discovered that red light
suppressed the tendency to peck. But conditions with red light turned out to be too
dark for human beings to work in. Tiny red spectacles for the chickens were tried, but
although these produced amusing pictures for Lifemagazine, they proved hopelessly
impractical. Recently, however, red contact lenses have been found effective.
They not only prevent pecking battles; they obviate the need for debeaking. As an
unexpected bonus, red contact lenses also reduce feed consumption by 6 percent,
thanks to reduced anxiety (nervous noshing, apparently, is not confined to humans)
and slightly increased egg production. Altogether, red contact lenses for chickens
have lowered production costs by a whopping third of a cent per egg in the flocks
where they have been tested. In the highly competitive egg business, that is a veritable
gusher of found money—not that competition will allow egg producers to keep much
of it.
When the United States entered World War II, the Delmarva Peninsula was
overwhelmingly dominant in the breeding of chickens for their meat, producing about
ninety million a year, up from seven million only eight years earlier. Its nearest
competitor, the state of Arkansas, produced only about eleven million. With the
coming of total war, though, the peninsula’s dominance of the chicken market turned
out to be a liability, for the War Food Administration commandeered the entire
production of the Delmarva for the use of the armed forces for the duration. As a
result, the evolutionary center of the poultry industry moved south as the northeastern
markets that the peninsula farmers had been serving looked elsewhere for chickens,
which were never rationed formally but could be hard to find in the grocery store.
Delmarva is rich agricultural land, but the new areas for chicken production that
burgeoned after the country entered World War II were marginal at best, and poultry
production came as a godsend to the hard-pressed farmers. No small factor in the
success of the new areas, however, was the energy and perseverance of the most
important figure in the creation of the modern poultry industry, Jesse Dixon Jewell.
He was born in Gainesville, Georgia, in 1902. Gainesville is located in the northern
part of the state, in the hardscrabble tag end of the Appalachian Mountains. The local 
farmers tried to make a living raising cotton, but with their small holdings, hilly
terrain, and poor, red clay soil, they could not compete successfully with the rich
cotton lands to the south and west.
Jewell’s father died when he was seven, and his mother tried to make a living running
a small feed store, a business Jewell took over when he reached adulthood. In the
mid-thirties, as depression devastated the American economy and a tornado nearly
destroyed Gainesville, Jewell supplemented his income by going around to the local
farms, buying chickens and eggs and taking them to Atlanta and other urban markets.
It was a hand-to-mouth operation at first. Often he had to sell quickly what he had
bought from the farmers in order to have the money in the bank to cover the checks he
had written to buy them. But demand for both eggs and chickens was strong, and
Jewell saw opportunity in expanding the raising of chickens in the area.
He recognized that these farmers needed nothing so much as a steady cash crop, but
they lacked even the small capital required to raise chickens the modern way. When
he tried to sell chicken feed to the farmers, few could afford it. So Jewell went to a
feed company and made a deal to get feed on consignment. Then he went to the local
bank and got a loan to buy day-old chicks.
He placed these chicks with the farmers, taking back a note secured by the chickens,
and supplied the feed needed to raise them to market weight. When the chickens were
ready for sale, Jewell would buy them, and he and the farmers would settle accounts.
Both the local banker and the feed companies were very skeptical at first, and the
banker made a point of sending someone out to see that the chicks were really where
Jewell said they were. But the system turned out to be profitable for all concerned, as
it lowered the final price to the consumer and thus further increased demand.
Jewell, a classic entrepreneur, began to expand his business both horizontally, by
making deals with more and more farmers, and vertically, by starting his own
hatchery and processing plant. Traditionally, chickens had been sold to city
wholesalers either still alive or what was termed “New York dressed”— that is, with
the feathers removed but the head, feet, and innards intact. By processing the chickens
at a plant and selling them ready to cook, Jewell not only reduced freight costs and
spoilage; he obtained a supply of by-products that found a ready market and so
increased his profits.
Chicken feet are exported in large numbers from this country to east Asia, where they
are considered a delicacy. Ground-up feathers—supplying high-quality protein—are
now an ingredient in animal feeds. Other bits and pieces end up in pet foods.
In 1954 J. D. Jewell, Inc., became a fully integrated poultry company when it
completed its own feed mill. Other poultry companies were integrating too, and as
they increased in size and expanded their markets, competition among them increased
as well, with the usual result of increased efficiency, innovation, and ever lower prices.
Between 1947 and 1960 broiler production in the southeastern states increased by
fully 365 percent. During the same period, production per man-hour increased by 343
percent. To put it another way, while production more than quadrupled, the man-hours
needed to handle that production increased by only 6 percent.
The new deal brought to American agriculture many governmental controls that
regulated prices, production, and returns to farmers. The poultry industry, still in its 
infancy in the 1930s, escaped this government-sponsored combination in restraint of
trade. But by the 1950s the largest companies were reaching for national markets, and
ferocious competition kept driving down prices. This development, a bonanza for the
chicken-eating public, allowed only the most modern and efficient operations to make
a profit. There began to be increased calls for a means “to stabilize production and
control prices for poultry products,” according to Herman Miller, director of U.S.
Department of Agriculture’s Marketing Service, Poultry Division.
Naturally, the least-efficient producers were behind this movement, and it was
spearheaded in Washington by Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey, who called for a
“nationwide, producer-controlled marketing program.” Translated from politicalese,
this meant a cartel.
The Eisenhower administration was unsympathetic. But when John F. Kennedy
became President in January 1961, the movement to organize the broiler industry took
on fresh drive. The new Secretary of Agriculture, Orville Freeman, organized the
National Broiler Stabilization Advisory Committee, made up of a wide variety of
industry executives.
No clear consensus was ever reached by the committee, however. It voted nineteen to
sixteen in favor of giving the Secretary of Agriculture authority to regulate the supply
of hatching eggs and thus the number of chickens available for market a few months
later. But of the sixteen dissenters, eight had voted against it because they wanted no
regulation at all. These latter feared that, no matter how lightly the hand of
government touched the industry at first, its grip would only tighten in the long run,
with disastrous consequences. As one opponent explained, with country eloquence,
“You can boil a frog if you put him in cold water and heat it gradually.”
Then, a vote of the nation’s turkey producers, representing an industry very similar in
its history to the broiler industry, overwhelmingly turned down government
involvement in the turkey market. Secretary Freeman saw the handwriting on the wall
and ended the Kennedy administration’s attempts to regulate the broiler and egg
industries as well. A free market in chicken and eggs continued. So, too, as a result,
did falling prices, constant innovation, and the soaring of the American appetite for
chicken.
Beginning in the late 1960s Frank Perdue used clever television commercials to turn
chicken, once the most generic of products, into a brand name and himself into a
celebrity. At the same time, Don Tyson began to make a small Arkansas poultry
company started by his father into a worldwide powerhouse that today sells five
million chickens a day—almost two billion a year.
As recently as 1960, if a shopper wanted chicken, he or she bought a chicken, often
one that was still New York dressed. Today the shopper can buy a whole chicken, a
cut-up chicken, chicken wings, legs, thighs, and breasts (boned or unboned), with or
without skin. The shopper can buy chicken ready-cooked (nicely browned and resting
in its own plastic carapace) or ready to cook, seasonings included. And, increasingly,
Americans are eating chicken either away from home or in its ready-to-eat form.
Tyson now sells nearly two-thirds of its production to restaurants and take-out chains
such as Boston Market or to food-processing companies like Stouffer’s.
Today we eat more chienk than we do beef, an astonishing turnabout for what was for
decades a society that ate more beef, per capita, than any other in the world except the
beef-obsessed Argentineans. Part of the reason for that, to be sure, is increased health
consciousness. But no small part is the fact that capitalism’s invisible hand has turned
a luxury into a commonplace.
The shopper who bought one of those 387 chickens that Mrs. Wilmer Steele first
raised deliberately for market in 1923 paid well over ten dollars a pound for it in 1994
dollars. Today a shopper can buy one from Perdue, Tyson, or any of dozens of other
chicken companies for less than one-tenth of that price.
That is no small accomplishment. And the thanks are due to countless, mostly
nameless individuals—farmers, feed-mill owners, breeders, transporters, scientists,
bankers, wholesalers, and the like—who sought only to make life a little better for
themselves and made it a little better for everyone—except the chickens—in the
process.
